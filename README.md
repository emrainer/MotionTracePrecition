# MotionTracePrediction


Treatment of moving targets using radiotherapy requires motion management systems to account for tumor motion. At UCSF, we use various motion management systems, and one of the most common techniques to measure motion uses an external marker. However, current external markers systems are complex and use expensive systems for measuring external motion. 

We are currently developing an iOS-based motion monitoring system that uses deep learning models to accurately monitor and predict patient motion. Using iOS sensor signals as model inputs, we are creating a model that predicts current and future (1-2 seconds) patient motion. We perform testing to evaluate model robustness between training and testing datasets.
